    "## Some rules\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you may do so, but must justify your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure you use the `data` folder provided in the repository in read-only mode. (Or alternatively, be sure you don’t change any of the files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Be sure to provide a concise textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation **(in markdown)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Please write all your comments in **English**, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the master/main branch. **If there are multiple notebooks present, we will not grade anything.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We will **not run your notebook for you!** Rather, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. Thus, be sure to hand in a **fully-run and evaluated notebook**. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In continuation to the previous point, interactive plots, such as those generated using the `plotly` package, should be strictly avoided!\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Make sure to print results and/or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",

    "\n",
    "Rebuttals in ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) conferences and in many other academic conferences are an important part of the peer-review process. They allow authors of submitted papers to respond to the reviews and comments provided by the reviewers before a final decision is made regarding the acceptance of the paper. Here's how the rebuttal process typically works in ACL conferences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Paper Submission: Authors submit their research papers to the ACL conference for review. These papers present novel research findings in computational linguistics, natural language processing, and related areas.\n",
    "- Peer Review: The papers undergo a peer-review process after the initial submission. The program committee or reviewers are experts in the field who evaluate the papers based on their quality, significance, novelty, methodology, and other relevant criteria. They provide comments and scores for each paper.\n",
    "- Rebuttal Period: After receiving the reviews, authors are given a specific period (usually around a week) to write a rebuttal. The rebuttal is a formal response to the reviewers' comments. It allows authors to clarify misunderstandings, address concerns, and provide additional information to support their paper's quality. \n",
    "- Final Review: After receiving the rebuttals, the reviewers may reconsider their initial assessments in light of the authors' responses. Reviewers may choose to maintain or adjust their reviews and scores based on the quality and effectiveness of the author's rebuttal.\n",
    "- Final Decision: The program committee or conference organizers consider the initial reviews/scores, rebuttals, and revised reviews/scores to make a final decision on the acceptance of the papers. The decision can be acceptance, rejection, or conditional acceptance with a request for revisions.\n",

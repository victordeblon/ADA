    "## Some rules\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you may do so, but must justify your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure you use the `data` folder provided in the repository in read-only mode. (Or alternatively, be sure you don’t change any of the files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Be sure to provide a concise textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation **(in markdown)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Please write all your comments in **English**, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the master/main branch. **If there are multiple notebooks present, we will not grade anything.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. We will **not run your notebook for you!** Rather, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. Thus, be sure to hand in a **fully-run and evaluated notebook**. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In continuation to the previous point, interactive plots, such as those generated using the `plotly` package, should be strictly avoided!\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Make sure to print results and/or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",

    "Congratulations! You have just been hired as a data scientist at \"The ByteBlasters\", EPFL’s amateur baseball club. The team's manager, Mr. Russo, an eccentric millionaire with an innovative plan to dominate the Swiss baseball league, believes hiring left-handed pitchers (the people who throw the ball) will likely boost the team's performance. Yet, he is concerned about money, as he heard left-handed pitchers have historically earned more!\n",
    "\n",
    "He tasked you to investigate this \"sinister\" issue and gave you some openly available data on the birthplace of this beautiful, dynamic sport --- the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "**About the homework.** This homework consists of four tasks. In Task 0, you will familiarize yourself with the rules of baseball. In Task 1, you will process the data, getting it ready for analysis. In Task 2, you will analyze the data to answer Mr. Russo’s question. Lastly, in Task 3, you will conduct additional analyses that consider the longitudinal nature of the data."
